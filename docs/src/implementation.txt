## The KIM API Portable Model Interface (KIM API/PMI)

In code, Portable Models (PMs) and Model Drivers (MDs) consist of up to eight
routines which perform specific tasks.

-# The <em>ModelCreate</em> (or \em ModelDriverCreate ) routine (required),
   which performs initialization tasks for the KIM::Model object.

-# The <em>ModelComputeArgumentsCreate</em> routine (required), which performs
   initialization tasks for a KIM::ComputeArguments object.

-# The \em ModelCompute routine (required), which uses the configuration
   information stored in a KIM::ComputeArguments object to perform the PM's
   core computational tasks.

-# The <em>ModelExtension</em> routine (optional), which provides a mechanism
   for creating and using non-standard extensions to the %KIM API.

-# The <em>ModelRefresh</em> routine (required if parameter pointers are set,
   otherwise should not be provided), which performs updates after a simulator
   makes changes to the PM's parameters (if this is supported).

-# The <em>ModelWriteParameterizedModel</em> (optional) routine, which can be
   used to write the parameter files and CMake file necessary to create a new
   parameterized PM from the current set of in-memory parameters.

-# The \em ModelComputeArgumentsDestroy routine (required), which performs
   finalization tasks for a KIM::ComputeArguments object.

-# The <em>ModelDestroy</em> routine (required), which performs finalization
   tasks for the KIM::Model object.

The %KIM API/PMI provides a separate interface to be used by the PM or MD.  For
each of the routines itemized above, the following table lists (i) the
associated KIM::ModelRoutineName extensible enumeration constant, (ii) links to
the associated %KIM API/PMI interface(s) available within the routine, (iii)
links to the routine's prototype (in C++, C, and Fortran), and (iv) whether the
%KIM API/PMI requires a PM or MD to provide the routine, or if it is optional.

The above table also indicates which routines must be provided by a PM.  For
optional routines, each PM must indicate that the routine is required or
optional for use by the simulator, as described below.

\note **Language restrictions implied by the %KIM API/PMI:**
<br>
The %KIM API/PMI implements a cross-language object-oriented-like framework.
All persistent data (analogous to member variables) needed by a PM or MD object
must be stored using the \ref cache_buffer_pointers "Caching Capabilities" of
the %KIM API.  For the framework to operate correctly, without surprising
behavior, PM and MD implementations must obey certain restrictions as described
below.

\note
- C++

  The use of static and/or global variables within PM and MD code must be
  avoided.

- C

  The use of static and/or global variables within PM and MD code must be
  avoided.

- Fortran

  The use of COMMON blocks must be avoided.  The use of the SAVE attribute must
  be avoided.  Thus, variables should not be initialized when they are declared
  (as this implies the SAVE attribute).  Further, the use of module variables,
  except for those defined with the PARAMETER attribute, must be avoided.  (The
  Fortran 2008 standard requires that all module variables, implicitly, have
  the SAVE attribute; that is, they are stored in static memory.)  Similarly,
  all Fortran subroutines and functions should have the RECURSIVE attribute
  (this is the default starting only with the Fortran 2015 standard).  This is
  because without the RECURSIVE attribute compilers are allowed to use static
  memory for a subroutine's/function's local variables (effectively giving them
  the SAVE attribute).

  These restrictions are even more important if thread-safety is required.  The
  use of RECURSIVE subroutines/functions and avoidance of using the SAVE
  attribute help to assure that memory access conflicts are averted.


The %KIM API/PMI provides two interfaces to be used by the Simulator,
KIM::Model and KIM::ComputeArguments, for interacting with a PM.  The
interaction between the simulator and a PM involves the following steps:

- A simulator creates a <em>Portable Model object</em>, by calling
  KIM::Model::Create, that will be used to exchange pointers to data and
  functions related to the PM between the simulator and PM.  Creating this
  object includes the specification of how the simulator will number particles
  (zero-based or one-based), determination of the physical base units that the
  PM will use, and execution of the PM's <em>ModelCreate</em> routine.

  When calling KIM::Model::Create to create a <em>PM object</em>, the simulator
  provides a set of "requested" base units that it would prefer to use.
  <em>The %KIM API/PMI gives the PM final authority to decide on the base units
  it will use.</em> Best practice for PMs is to respect the request of the
  simulator and to use the requested base units by converting its parameters
  appropriately.  The \c requestedUnitsAccepted output argument of the
  KIM::Model::Create routine is a convenience that allows the simulator a
  short-cut to determine if its request for base units was accepted.  (The
  alternative is for the simulator to call to KIM::Model::GetUnits and compare
  the results to the requested units.)

  If a base unit is not relevant to the simulator (e.g., a unit of time is not
  necessary for static equilibrium computations), then the simulator should
  specify that the corresponding requested base unit(s) is/are "unused".
  Similarly, if a base unit is irrelevant to the PM (e.g., many models only
  require units of length and energy; Thus, units of charge, temperature, and
  time are irrelevant), then the PM should specify that the corresponding base
  unit(s) is/are "unused" (regardless of the simulator's requested values) when
  calling KIM::ModelCreate::SetUnits within its <em>ModelCreate</em> routine.
  Additionally, the PM should select its preferred (non-"unused") base unit
  value when the simulator provides a request of "unused" for a relevant base
  unit.

  The %KIM API/PMI supports "Toy Models", which are a deliberately simplistic
  model with many details removed so that it can be used to explain a mechanism
  concisely.  Toy models do not model a real material, but are rather
  associated with a class of materials (e.g., glasses).  Toy PMs should use the
  "user" species values (KIM::SPECIES_NAME::user01 through
  KIM::SPECIES_NAME::user20).  Some toy models are formulated to be
  nondimensional.  Rather than introducing a new type of nondimensional units
  to the %KIM API/PMI with accompanying requirements for simulators to support
  this, toy PMs should define their length base unit as KIM::LENGTH_UNIT::A and
  their energy base unit as KIM::ENERGY_UNIT::eV.  From the perspective of the
  toy PM these can be considered proxy units (similar to Lennard-Jones units).
  (See also [Toy Model support within
  openkim.org](https://openkim.org/about-toy-models).)

- Once a PM object is obtained, the simulator should use
  KIM::Model::IsRoutinePresent to determine which routines the PM has provided
  and if they are required or optional.  From this information the simulator
  should determine if it can proceed to work with the PM, or if the PM requires
  the use of routines that are not supported by the simulator it should exit.

- Next, the simulator creates a <em>KIM::ComputeArguments object</em>, by
  calling KIM::Model::ComputeArgumentsCreate, that will be used to exchange
  pointers to data and functions related to the atomic configuration and values
  being computed for it.  Creating this object includes execution of the PM's
  <em>ModelComputeArgumentsCreate</em> routine.

- Then, to perform a computation, the simulator provides a compute-arguments
  object to the KIM::Model::Compute routine (which, in part, executes the PM's
  <em>ModelCompute</em> function).

  - There are input compute-arguments that include the various components that
    make up a configuration (number of particles, particle position vectors,
    etc.).

  - There are output compute-arguments that include the quantities (like partial
    energy and partial forces), defined in Section \ref theory, associated with
    the configuration.

  - There are also compute-callback functions (such as a function to get a
    particle's neighbor list) that the simulator provides for use by the PM.

- When a simulator is finished working with a PM, it needs to clean up by
  calling KIM::Model::ComputeArgumentsDestroy (which, in part, executes the
  PM's <em>ModelComputeArgumentsDestroy</em> routine) to delete each of the
  compute-arguments objects that were created, and finally calling
  KIM::Model::Destroy (which, in part, executes the PM's <em>ModelDestroy</em>
  routine) to delete the KIM::Model object.

The %KIM API/PMI provides a list of all compute-arguments and compute-callbacks
defined as part of the official API.  Each argument and callback has a "Support
Status" that can be one of four values: <em>requiredByAPI</em>,
<em>notSupported</em>, <em>required</em>, or <em>optional</em>.  A PM specifies
a support status value, as part of its <em>ModelComputeArgumentsCreate</em>
routine, for every compute-argument and compute-callback defined by the %KIM
API/PMI.  Some arguments and callbacks are required by the %KIM API and can
only have a support status of <em>requiredByAPI</em>.  All other arguments and
callbacks are not required by the %KIM API/PMI, and therefore the PM may set
their support status to any one of the three remaining options:
<em>required</em>, <em>optional</em>, or <em>notSupported</em>.  Just before
the PM's <em>ModelComputeArgumentsCreate</em> routine is executed, the %KIM
API/PMI initializes the support status of all arguments and callbacks to either
<em>requiredByAPI</em> or <em>notSupported</em>, as indicated in the below
tables.  It is the responsibility of the simulator to use the
KIM::ComputeArguments object interface to determine the support status of each
compute-argument and compute-callback and to use this information to determine
if the PM is capable of performing the desired computation.

Below, lists of each input compute-argument, output compute-argument, and
compute-callback are provided.  To be explicit, zero-based particle
numbering is used where necessary.

Input compute-argument table:
| Compute Argument Name | Unit   | Data Type | Extent                | Memory Layout                                                      | Valid Support Statuses (bold -- default) |

- numberOfParticles is the number of particles (contributing and
non-contributing) in the configuration.

- particleSpeciesCodes contains integer codes (as defined by the PM) specifying
the species of each particle.  For example, if the PM defines the mapping Cu
\f$\leftrightarrow 1\f$, Al \f$\leftrightarrow 2\f$, and Ni \f$\leftrightarrow
3\f$, then \f$sc^{(0)} = 3, sc^{(1)} = 1, sc^{(2)} = 2, \dots\f$ means that
particle 0 is a nickel atom, particle 1 is a copper atom, particle 2 is an
aluminum atom.

- particleContributing contains the contributing/non-contributing status
of each particle.  Particle \f$i\f$ is contributing if \f$c^{(i)} = 1\f$ and
non-contributing if \f$c^{(i)} = 0\f$.

- coordinates contains the Cartesian components of the particles' position
  vectors, \f$\mathbf{r}^{(i)} = r^{(i)}_1 \mathbf{e}_1 + r^{(i)}_2
  \mathbf{e}_2 + r^{(i)}_3 \mathbf{e}_3\f$.

- partialEnergy is the configuration's partial energy \f$E^{\mathcal{C}}\f$.

- partialForces contains the partial force vector for each particle,
  \f$\mathbf{f}^{\mathcal{C}(i)} = f^{\mathcal{C}(i)}_1 \mathbf{e}_1 +
  f^{\mathcal{C}(i)}_2 \mathbf{e}_2 + f^{\mathcal{C}(i)}_3 \mathbf{e}_3\f$.

- partialParticleEnergy contains the partial particle energy for each particle,
  \f$E^{\mathcal{C}}_i\f$.

- partialVirial is the configuration's partial virial tensor,
  \f$\mathbf{V}^{\mathcal{C}}\f$.

- partialParticleVirial contains the partial particle virial tensor for each
  particle, \f$\mathbf{V}^{\mathcal{C}(i)}\f$.



Compute-callback table:
| Compute Callback Name | Valid Support Statuses (bold -- default) |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| GetNeighborList       | <b>requiredByAPI</b>                     |
| ProcessDEDrTerm       | required, optional, <b>notSupported</b>  |
| ProcessD2EDr2Term     | required, optional, <b>notSupported</b>  |

- GetNeighborList is a callback function that allows a PM to obtain the list of
  neighbors of a particle.  The PM may request any number (\f$\ge1\f$) of
  neighbor lists with different (or equal) cutoff distances.  The
  GetNeighborList callback function must support the return of the appropriate
  list of neighbors.  The returned list of neighbors consists of a
  contiguous-in-memory list of integers corresponding to an unordered full list
  of a particle's neighbors (not including itself).  Each such neighbor list
  must contain at least all particles within the corresponding cutoff distance
  of the specified particle.  (However, the returned list may contain particles
  beyond the cutoff distance.)  Neighbor lists provided by the simulator must
  be consistent with the configuration coordinates and the PM's cutoff values.
  In particular, the PM must, in principle, be able to independently construct
  its own equivalent neighbor list using just the particle coordinates.
  Further, the GetNeighborList callback routine must check to ensure that the
  neighbor list data (provided, via the simulator, by the compute-arguments
  object) is consistent with the PM's cutoff values.

  <b>CAUTION - SIMULATOR DEVELOPERS:</b> In general, it is important that
  neighbor lists provided by a simulator are "efficient" in the sense that the
  list contains only a small number of particles that are located outside the
  cutoff distance.  If the lists are not efficient, then the PM computational
  time may be <em>severely</em> impacted.  This is especially true for PMs that
  request multiple neighbor lists with a wide range of cutoff distances.

  <b>Neighbor List Hint \anchor neighbor_list_hint :</b> The above describes
  the default behavior and all PMs must work correctly when provided with
  neighbor lists of this type.  However, based on the <em>neighbor list
  hint</em> provided by the PM a simulator may provide the PM with a modified
  neighbor list that is more efficient.  If the PM sets its
  "modelWillNotRequestNeighborsOfNoncontributingParticles" value to 1 (true),
  it is guaranteeing that it will not request the neighbors of non-contributing
  particles.  In this case, the simulator does not need to generate a neighbor
  list for such particles.  The PM has no way of knowing if the simulator is
  taking advantage of its hint, so it must work correctly for all types of
  neighbor lists consistent with its provided hint.

- ProcessDEDrTerm is a callback function that allows for access to the
  derivatives of the configuration's partial energy, \f$E^{\mathcal{C}}\f$,
  with respect to all pair-distances, \f$r^{(i,j)}, i,j \in C_{p}\f$.  That is,
  it allows the PM to communicate the values of \f$\frac{\partial
  E^{\mathcal{C}}}{\partial r^{(i,j)}}\f$ to the simulator.  Recall that
  \f$r^{(i,j)}\f$ and \f$r^{(j,i)}\f$ are just two different notations for the
  same quantity.  Thus, there are only \f$\frac{\text{numberOfParticles} \cdot
  (\text{numberOfParticles} + 1)}{2}\f$ quantities (as opposed to
  \f$(\text{numberOfParticles})^2\f$) referred to by the notation
  \f$\frac{\partial E^{\mathcal{C}}}{\partial r^{(i,j)}}\f$.

  These quantities can be used to compute many quantities of interest
  associated with the configuration.  For example, it is possible to
  independently compute the partial virial from this information using the
  formula

  \f[

  = \sum_{i \in C_p} \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}^{(i)}_{r_{\text{infl}}}} \;\;
  \sum_{k \not= j; \; k \in \bar{\mathcal{N}}^{(i)}_{r_{\text{infl}}}}
  \left(\frac{1}{2 r^{(j,k)}} \frac{\partial \tilde{E}_i}{\partial r^{(j,k)}}
  \right) \mathbf{r}^{(j,k)} \otimes \mathbf{r}^{(j,k)}.

- ProcessD2EDr2Term is a callback function that allows for access to the second
  derivatives of the configuration's partial energy, \f$E^{\mathcal{C}}\f$,
  with respect to all pair-distances, \f$r^{(i,j)}, i,j \in C_{p}\f$.  That is,
  it allows the PM to communicate the values of \f$\frac{\partial^2
  E^{\mathcal{C}}}{\partial r^{(i,j)} \partial r^{(m,n)}}\f$ to the simulator.

## The KIM API Simulator Model Interface (KIM API/SMI)

In code, Simulator Models (SMs) are simply a set of <em>parameter files</em>
and a <em>specification file</em> which contains simulator input commands and
metadata (supported species, units, etc.) needed to run the model in its native
simulator.

The %KIM API/SMI consists of the KIM::SimulatorModel interface which provides
programatic access to the SM's parameter files and the contents of its
specification file.  Conceptually, an SM specification file contains a series
of key-value pairs.  Some key-value pairs are defined and required by the %KIM
API/SMI.  All other key-value pairs are called "Simulator Fields".  For
flexibility and generality, the content and meaning of the simulator fields is
not defined by the %KIM API/SMI.  Instead, each simulator is free to create and
define its own set of specifications.  The value part of a simulator field
key-value pair is one or more strings called "Simulator Field Lines".  These
strings may contain template tags (of the form "@<template-tag-key>@") which
the KIM::SimulatorModel object will replace by performing template substitution
using the "Template Map".  The %KIM API/SMI defines a small set of template
mappings which facilitate providing copies of the SM's parameter files to the
simulator.  Additionally, simulators may define their own template mappings and
add these to the %KIM API/SMI's set to be used for template substitution.

Although the %KIM API/SMI is designed for maximum flexibility, an example of
one way it can be used by a simulator to support SMs is helpful.  In
particular, for the [LAMMPS](https://lammps.sandia.gov) simulator, performing a
simulation with a specific model typically involves three separate parts: (1)
specifying the physical units in which the model's parameters are given and
therefore the units in which the simulation will be performed; (2) specifying
other default properties needed by the model which must be set before the
LAMMPS simulation box is defined, such as the LAMMPS atom style; and (3)
specifying the `pair_style` or other style commands that define the model's
interactions and read in the model's parameter files.  Here is an example
LAMMPS input file for the ReaxFF potential, similar to the CHO example included
in the LAMMPS distribution.

\code{.unparsed}
# REAX potential for CHO system

units           real

atom_style      charge
neigh_modify    every 10 delay 0 check no

neighbor        2 bin

read_data       data.CHO

pair_style      reax/c lmp_control
pair_coeff      * * ffield.reax.cho H C O
fix             reaxqeq all qeq/reax 1 0.0 10.0 1e-6 param.qeq

fix             1 all nve
fix             2 all temp/berendsen 500.0 500.0 100.0

timestep        0.25

run             100
\endcode

In this case, the `units` line corresponds to (1) above.  The `atom_style` and
`neigh_modify` lines correspond to (2) above.  And, the `pair_style`,
`pair_coeff`, and `fix reaxqeq` lines correspond to (3) above.  The strings
"lmp_control", "ffield.reax.cho", and "param.qeq" are parameter file names
(which are expected to be in the current working directory, since the names do
not start with a '/').  Also of note is the string of parameters "H C O" on the
`pair_coeff` line, which specifies a mapping between the species names "H",
"C", and "O" used by the ReaxFF model and the LAMMPS atom type numbers 1, 2,
and 3, respectively.  The number of atom types and their species mapping are
part of the simulation, not part of the model.  In this case these values are
specified within the "data.CHO" input file listed on the `read_data` line.
Since the number of atom types and the species map can change from simulation
to simulation, any LAMMPS %KIM SM implementation will need a way of specifying
the atom type mapping on the `pair_coeff` line.

The LAMMPS SM implementation accommodates all of these needs by defining three
Simulator Fields, corresponding to the three parts of a LAMMPS model
specification discussed above. (1) A "units" field, with a single line
containing the LAMMPS unit system string required by the model.  (2) A
"model-init" field, with zero or more lines containing, in this case, the
`atom_style` and `neigh_modify` commands.  And (3) a "model-defn" field, with
zero or more lines containing, in this case, the `pair_style`, `pair_coeff`,
and `fix reaxqeq` commands.  In the latter field lines, the correct parameter
file names are obtained through the %KIM API/SMI's template substitution
mechanism, using the standard template keys for the SM's parameter files.  The
correct atom type mapping is obtained through a special, LAMMPS defined,
template map with key "atom-type-sym-list".  The result of all of these
considerations and definitions is the following SM specification file (see the
\ref kim_api_sm_schema_version_1 "KIM API/SMI Specification File Schema" for
details of the file format) for the LAMMPS ReaxFF model.

\code{.edn}
{
  "kim-api-sm-schema-version" 1
  "model-name" "Sim_LAMMPS_ReaxFF_ChenowethVanDuinGoddard_2008_CHO__SM_584143153761_000"
  "simulator-name" "LAMMPS"
  "simulator-version" "28 Feb 2019"
  "supported-species" "C H O"
  "units" "real"
  "model-init" [ "atom_style charge"
                 "neigh_modify one 4000"
               ]
  "model-defn" [ "pair_style reax/c @<parameter-file-2>@ safezone 2.0 mincap 100"
                 "pair_coeff * * @<parameter-file-1>@ @<atom-type-sym-list>@"
                 "fix reaxqeq all qeq/reax 1 0.0 10.0 1.0e-6 @<parameter-file-3>@"
               ]
}
\endcode

The ordering of the SM's parameter files is specified in the SM's \c
CMakeLists.txt configuration file.  With this SM defined and installed in one
of the %KIM API collections, the following is equivalent to the above LAMMPS
input script.

\code{.unparsed}
# REAX potential for CHO system

kim_init          Sim_LAMMPS_ReaxFF_ChenowethVanDuinGoddard_2008_CHO__SM_584143153761_000 real

neighbor          2 bin

read_data         data.CHO

kim_interactions  C H O

fix               1 all nve
fix               2 all temp/berendsen 500.0 500.0 100.0

timestep          0.25

run               100
\endcode

the %KIM API/SMI.

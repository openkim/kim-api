/**
\page cmake_files Explaination of CMake Files for %KIM API Items and Simulators

Previous Section: \ref implementation.

This section describes the content of [CMake](https://cmake.org) files
necessary for the configuration and build of %KIM API items (Model Drivers,
Portable Models, and Simulator Models) as well as for Simulators.  Details are
also provided for Simulators that do not use the CMake build system.

  Driver) CMakeLists.txt files\endlink

\anchor cmake_files_model_drivers
## Model Driver CMakeLists.txt files

Here is the `CMakeLists.txt` file for the example Model Driver \link
../examples/model-drivers/ex_model_driver_P_LJ ex_model_driver_P_LJ\endlink.

\dontinclude ex_model_driver_P_LJ/CMakeLists.txt
\skip cmake_minimum
\until target_sources

Let us go through this line by line to explain.

\dontinclude ex_model_driver_P_LJ/CMakeLists.txt
\skipline cmake_minimum

This line ensures that an appropriate version of CMake is being used.

\skip list
\until find_package

These lines tell CMake to find the settings for building %KIM API items with
the %KIM API library installed on the system.

\skipline kim_api_items_setup_before

This line performs various setup necessary to configure and build a Model
Driver item.  (These settings must be performed before the `project` command on
the next line.)

\skipline project

This line tells CMake to create a "project" with name equal to the item's name
`ex_model_driver_P_LJ` and that the item will require a `Fortran` compiler to
be built.

\skipline kim_api_items_setup_after

This line performs various setup necessary to configure and build a Model
Driver item.  (These settings must be performed after the `project` command on
the previous line.)

\skip add_kim_api
\until )

These lines register the item with the %KIM API CMake build system and provide
necessary metadata.  The `NAME` argument is required and here the CMake
variable `PROJECT_NAME`, which was set as a result of the `project` command
(above), is used to provide the name of the Model Driver item.

The `CREATE_ROUTINE_NAME` argument specifies the identifier used to define the
KIM::ModelDriverCreate routine for the item.  This argument is required.

The `CREATE_ROUTINE_LANGUAGE` argument specifies the programming language in
which the create routine is written (valid values are: `cpp`, `c`, and
`fortran`).

There is also an additional (optional) argument `METADATA_FILES`.  This can be
set to a space separated list of file names that should be included with the
Model Driver item as metadata files.  These metadata files will not be directly
used by the %KIM API in any way, but they may be accessed through the
KIM::Collections interface.

\skipline target_sources

This line associates the item's source code files with its CMake "target",
which is set to the value given for the `NAME` argument in the call to
`add_kim_api_model_driver_library`.  After the `PRIVATE` keyword a space
separated list of source code file names can be given.  This list of files
should contain all source code (not header) files that are necessary to compile
and build the Model Driver item.  In this example there is just a single
Fortran soruce file with the same name as the item.


\anchor cmake_files_portable_model_using
## Portable Model using a Model Driver CMakeLists.txt files

Here is the `CMakeLists.txt` file for the example Portable Model \link
../examples/portable-models/ex_model_Ar_P_Morse ex_model_Ar_P_Morse\endlink.

\dontinclude ex_model_Ar_P_Morse/CMakeLists.txt
\skip cmake_minimum
\until PARAMETER
\skipline )

Let us go through this line by line to explain.

\dontinclude ex_model_Ar_P_Morse/CMakeLists.txt
\skipline cmake_minimum

This line ensures that an appropriate version of CMake is being used.

\skip list
\until find_package

These lines tell CMake to find the settings for building %KIM API items with
the %KIM API library installed on the system.

\skipline kim_api_items_setup_before

This line performs various setup necessary to configure and build a Portable
Model item.  (These settings must be performed before the `project` command on
the next line.)

\skipline project

This line tells CMake to create a "project" with name equal to the item's name
`ex_model_Ar_P_Morse` and that the item does not explicitly require compiler to
be built.

\skipline kim_api_items_setup_after

This line performs various setup necessary to configure and build a Portable
Model item.  (These settings must be performed after the `project` command on
the previous line.)

\skip add_kim_api
\until )

These lines register the item with the %KIM API CMake build system and provide
necessary metadata.  The `NAME` argument is required and here the CMake
variable `PROJECT_NAME`, which was set as a result of the `project` command
(above), is used to provide the name of the Portable Model item.

The `DRIVER_NAME` argument specifies the Model Driver used used by Portable
Model item.  This argument is required.

The `PARAMETER_FILES` argument specifies an ordered, space separated list of
parameter files required for use by the Model Driver.  In this case there is
just a single parameter file, but in general a Model Driver may require any
number of such files.  In addition to the number of parameter files, the Model
Driver also specifies the order in which they must be listed and the file
format(s) for their content.

There is also an additional (optional) argument `METADATA_FILES`.  This can be
set to a space separated list of file names that should be included with the
Portable Model item as metadata files.  These metadata files will not be
directly used by the %KIM API in any way, but they may be accessed through the
KIM::Collections interface.


\anchor cmake_files_simulator_model
## Simulator Model CMakeLists.txt files

Here is the `CMakeLists.txt` file for the example Simulator Model \link
../examples/simulator-models/Sim_LAMMPS_LJcut_AkersonElliott_Alchemy_PbAu
Sim_LAMMPS_LJcut_AkersonElliott_Alchemy_PbAu\endlink.

\dontinclude Sim_LAMMPS_LJcut_AkersonElliott_Alchemy_PbAu/CMakeLists.txt
\skip cmake_minimum
\until PARAMETER
\skipline )

Let us go through this line by line to explain.

\dontinclude Sim_LAMMPS_LJcut_AkersonElliott_Alchemy_PbAu/CMakeLists.txt
\skipline cmake_minimum

This line ensures that an appropriate version of CMake is being used.

\skip list
\until find_package

These lines tell CMake to find the settings for building %KIM API items with
the %KIM API library installed on the system.

\skipline kim_api_items_setup_before

This line performs various setup necessary to configure and build a Simulator
Model item.  (These settings must be performed before the `project` command on
the next line.)

\skipline project

This line tells CMake to create a "project" with name equal to the item's name
`Sim_LAMMPS_LJcut_AkersonElliott_Alchemy_PbAu` and that the item will not
explicitly require a compiler to be built.

\skipline kim_api_items_setup_after

This line performs various setup necessary to configure and build a Simulator
Model item.  (These settings must be performed after the `project` command on
the previous line.)

\skip add_kim_api
\until )

These lines register the item with the %KIM API CMake build system and provide
necessary metadata.  The `NAME` argument is required and here the CMake
variable `PROJECT_NAME`, which was set as a result of the `project` command
(above), is used to provide the name of the Simulator Model item.

The `SM_SPEC_FILE` argument specifies the name of the \ref
kim_api_sm_schema_version_1 "KIM API/SMI Specification File" for the Simulator
Model.

The `PARAMETER_FILES` argument specifies an ordered, space separated list of
parameter files required for use by the Simulator Model.  In this case there is
just a single parameter file, but in general a Simulator Model may require any
number of such files.  In addition to the number of parameter files, the
Simulator Model also specifies the order in which they must be listed and the
file format(s) for their content.

There is also an additional (optional) argument `METADATA_FILES`.  This can be
set to a space separated list of file names that should be included with the
Simulator Model item as metadata files.  These metadata files will not be
directly used by the %KIM API in any way, but they may be accessed through the
KIM::Collections interface.

## Simulators using CMake CMakeLists.txt files

\todo Add description of CMakeLists.txt files for simulators/projects that use
the %KIM-API library and use CMake.

For now, see \link ../examples/simulators/utility_forces_numer_deriv
utility_forces_numer_deriv\endlink and its CMakeLists.txt file given here.

\dontinclude utility_forces_numer_deriv/CMakeLists.txt
\skip cmake_minimum

\anchor make_files_simulators
## Simulators not using CMake

\todo Add description of getting build details via `pkg-config` for
simulators/projects that use the %KIM-API library but do not use CMake.

This file contains a list of planned improvements and new features for the
KIM API package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Items planned for the next significant release.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Introduce a "sparse array" type (for use with `hessian' and similar arguments)

* Improve error handling consistency within the API

* Refactor the core KIM API code for improved readability and maintenance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Items planned for future releases.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Implement full support for Tests written in Python

* Implement full support for Tests written in Java

* Create an example Model and Test written in C++ that makes full use of the
  object oriented nature of the language.

* Implement a new NBC method, similar to NEIGH_RVEC_F, that includes a
  ForceTransformation() function that can be applied to each atom.  This will
  provide additional support for exotic boundary conditions such as "Objective
  Boundary Conditions", twist boundary conditions, etc.

* Implement support for force-fields (CHARMM/GROMACS) type KIM Models.

* Add Doxygen commenting for improved code documentation.

* Implement a framework for unit and regression testing of all the code in the
  KIM API package.

* Fixes to Fortran documentation and cross-references.

* Added information/links to the top level README.md


=== kim-api-2.1.2 =============== 29Jul2019 ====================================

* Fixup Fortran kim_collections_module interfaces to be consistent with c/c++.

* Fixup collections-management for portabability to dash.

* Improve item-wrapper.cpp.in for more standard compliant MD, MO, SM behavior.

* Improve zsh completion install behavior.

* Fixup Fortran c_long communication and overflow behavior.

* Add missing testing of interface in examples/simulators/collections-example.

* Improve example/simulators to remove warnings.

* Fix bug in KIM::SimulatorModel::Create().


=== kim-api-2.1.1 =============== 24Jul2019 ====================================

* Refactor 'kim-api-collections-management list' code for performance.

* Update collections-management to use 'make -j2' for improved performance.

  Makefile.  The conventional name for these files now ends in ".kim.tpl".

* Model ".kim" file name is now specified in the Makefile and can be anything
  the developer desires.

* Remove deprecated KIM_API_init() routine.

* Remove deprecated Fortran Cray pointer support.

* Update examples to use KIM_API_file_init() and name their ".kim" file
  "descriptor.kim" in accordance with the new convention of the openkim.org
  processing pipeline.

* Deprecate KIM_API_init() and add KIM_API_file_init() to replace it as the
  primary openkim.org Tests should initialize the KIM API and specify their KIM
  descriptor files.

* Portability fixes for the make system

* Move away from naming various files based on the item (Model Driver, Model,
  Test) name.  Instead establish standard names for each item type.

* Added Makefile.Version to provided the make system with version information
  and set policy (based on SemVer 2.0.0) for how, when, and why to update the
  version.

* Significant updates to the make system.  Primarily associated with
  installation of the KIM API to a system-wide location, and its use once
  installed there.

* Documentation updates.

* Various bug fixes.

* Added support for searching ${HOME}/.kim/ and ./ for Models and Model Drivers
  when the package is installed via the `make install' command.

* Added install and uninstall targets to the Make system.

* Now the build system (in dynamic-load and dynamic-link modes) hides all
  symbols in the Model Driver and Model libraries except for the model_init()
  function and the Model's kim descriptor string.  This means that there is no
  need to worry about symbol clashes between Models, Model Drivers, or Tests.

* Implemented dynamic-load, dynamic-link, and static-link build options.

* Make system now provides only summary information on the build process.  This
  makes the progress easier to understand.  To see the actual build commands
  use `make -n'.

* Removed `integer*8' and changed `real' and `real*8' to `float' and `double'.

* Now use -g, -Wall, and -pedantic by default for all compilations.

* Changed model_init() function conventions to simplify the scheme.  This also
  resulted in the removal of the Model or Test name from the descriptor files.

* Added the openkim-api-descriptor-file-match utility.

* Completely rewrote and streamlined the openkim-api Make system

* Changed directory names from trailing `s' to trailing `S'.

* Updated example Tests and Models to use the new get/set method routines.

  vc_forces_delta to the distribution.


=== openkim-api-v1.1.1 ========== 19Aug2012 ====================================


* Added run_forces_numer_deriv_for_all_models script that will run and
  summarize the results of vc_forces_numer_deriv for all available Models.

* Added vc_forces_numer_deriv "verification check" that can be used with any
  Model to check the consistency of its computed forces with a numerical
  derivative based on the Model's energy.

* Fixed a bug in the MI_OPBC_* support for ex_model_Ne_P_fastLJ

* Fixed a bug in the make system that occurred when using static linking that
  would cause some Models to be incorrectly identified as "unknown"

* ex_test_*_free_cluster and ex_test_*_free_cluster_stiff now support CLUSTER
  NBC (which means they work with ALL NBC methods)

* Documentation updates

* Updated 32/64 bit switching in Fortran code for easier maintenance

* Moved library compile flags to end of command line to make sure all libraries
  are correctly associated with the appropriate .so files

  management and PARAM_* handling


=== openkim-api-v1.1.0 ========== 12Jul2012 ====================================


* Documentation updates

* Introduced the use of THIS_FILE_NAME in Fortran examples instead of __FILE__.
  This allows for easily setting the value of THIS_FILE_NAME to something
  appropriate (short) when the default preprocessor value of __FILE__ is longer
  that 132 characters (the max line length for Fortran)

* Changed KIM standard time unit from `fs' to `ps' to be consistent with LAMMPS
  `metal' unit system

* Changed KIM_COMPUTE and KIM_NOT_COMPUTE to KIM_COMPUTE_TRUE and
  KIM_COMPUTE_FALSE, respectively

* Removed KIM_API_MAX_NEIGHBORS; the api no longer puts any restriction on the
  number of neighbors for an atom

* Updated api and examples to always `return' with an error code instead of
  `exit' or `stop'.  This allows the Test to handle errors and is a better
  convention for error handling

* Added KIM_STATUS_MODEL_UNSUPPORTED_CONFIGURATION for cases where a
  configuration is identified at run time as unsupported

* Removed requirement for a trailing `/' in environment variables (such as
  $KIM_DIR)

* Added make warning if `make' is invoked from a Model directory when static
  linking is being used.

* Added `make examples-force' target

* `make examples' only copies files; it no longer also compiles everything

* Changed all call-back interfaces (model_init, model_reinit, model_compute,
  model_destroy) to be consistent: integer functions (in Fortran speak).  Also
  updated examples and templates to conform to this new interface.

* Documentation updates


=== openkim-api-v1.0.0 ========== 22Feb2012 ====================================


* Moved all examples to EXAMPLES directory and added `make examples' target.

* Renamed all example Model Drivers, Models, and Tests.  Now have `ex_' prefix.

* Renamed nearly all API functions to improve readability and comprehension.

* Changed KIM_API_get_half_neigh and KIM_API_get_full_neigh to just
  KIM_API_get_neigh.

* Total re-work of unit handling for the API.

* Added KIM_API_model_info() function for Tests to use for discovering what a
  Model supports.

* Added KIM_API_getm_* and KIM_API_setm_* routines to get/set multiple arguments
  in one function call.

* Added KIM_API_sting_init() for use by Tests that generate their KIM descriptor
  file "on-the-fly".

* Added process_dEdr and process_dE2dr2 approach for calculating general
  properties.  Currently automatic support for `virial', `particleVirial', and
  `hessian' is available.

* Added "unsymmetric half neighbor lists" (numberContributingParticles).

* Added model/test buffers for use by Model and Test, respectively.

* Improvements in dynamic linking setup.

* Examples additions, improvements, and bug fixes.

* Bug fixes.


=== openkim-api-v0.2.0 ========== 15Sep2011 ====================================


* Updated documentation

* Added KIM_API_report_error() service function and updated all examples
  and templates to use this function.

* Added KIMstatus.h which contains definitions of KIM status codes.

* Added KIM_API_status_msg() service routine to return a string describing a
  given status code.

* Updated messages printed to kim.log file to be more informative.

* Model KIM descriptor files are now incorporated into the Model's binary
  library file.  This means that the file is no longer required at run time and
  that the Model must be recompiled after changes to the descriptor file.

* Added Model Driver Templates

* Added two Model Drivers and four Models based on the Model Drivers

* Removed example model_Ar_P_MMorse in favor of the Morse Driver and its Models

* Added support for Model Drivers

* Bug fixes


=== openkim-api-v0.1.2 ========== 22Aug2011 ====================================


* Fixed a number of bugs in the examples related to running on 64bit machines

* Fixed a bug in kim_api_get_nbc_method_f() related to running on 64bit
  machines


=== openkim-api-v0.1.1 ========== 16Aug2011 ====================================


* Fixed memory handling bug associated with the service functions
     KIM_API_get_listAtomTypes()
     KIM_API_get_listParams()
     KIM_API_get_listFreeParams()
     KIM_API_get_listFixedParams()
     KIM_API_get_NBC_method()

* Fixed bug in test_**_free_cluster.F90

* Renamed `README.git' to `README_GIT' to avoid confusion with the
  git convention that the extension `.git' refers to a bare repository


=== openkim-api-v0.1.0 ========== 08Aug2011 ====================================


* Added TEMPLATE files to help users create their own KIM Models.

* Added a number of example Models and Tests to help users understand how to
  implement their own openkim-api compliant codes.

* Added support for ATOM/PARTICLE types

* Added support for Models to publish their parameters

* Added support for Models to define a `reinit' function for use when their
  parameters are changed by a Test.

* Added support for neighbor list and boundary conditions (NBC)

* Added support for dynamic linking

* Updated documentation

* Added documentation to the standard.kim file which now describes in detail
  the format and content of KIM descriptor files.

* Added README files to every directory.  These files provide a short

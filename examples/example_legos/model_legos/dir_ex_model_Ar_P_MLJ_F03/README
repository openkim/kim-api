This directory (ex_model_Ar_P_MLJ_F03) contains a modified Lennard Jones (LJ)
Model with smoothed cutoff radius written in Fortran 2003.  It complies with
the KIM API library, supporting all NBCs and Locator and Iterator mode, and
publishes its parameters, and supports optional computation of `energy',
`forces', `particleEnergy', and `virial'.

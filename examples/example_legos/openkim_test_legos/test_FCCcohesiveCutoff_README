This directory (TEST_NAME_STR) contains a test that computes the minimum energy
per particle in an infinite perfect FCC crystal of SPECIES_NAME_STR particles
for a range of values for the Model's cutoff parameter.  (The test uses the
most efficient calculation method possible for the NBC method it uses.)

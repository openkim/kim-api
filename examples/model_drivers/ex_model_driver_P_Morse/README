This directory (ex_model_driver_P_Morse) contains a shifted Morse pair potential
Model driver written in C.

   phi(r) = epsilon * ( - exp[ -2*C*(r - Rzero) ] + 2*exp[ -C*(r - Rzero) ] )
            + shift

where shift is computed so that phi(rcut) = 0.0

To create a KIM Model from this Model Driver, one parameter file is required.
This file must have the following format:
   Line 1: `SpeciesName' string with element symbol
   Line 2: `cutoff' value in angstroms
   Line 3: Morse `epsilon' value in eV
   Line 4: Morse `C' value in 1/Angstroms
   Line 5: Morse `Rzero' value in Angstroms
Any additional lines will be silently ignored.

This directory contains a model consisting of the superposition of two shifted
Morse pair potentials with different cutoffs.

   phi_i(r) = epsilon_i * ( - exp[ -2*C_i*(r - Rzero_i) ]
                            + 2*exp[ -C_i*(r - Rzero_i) ] )
            + shift_i,

for i=1,2 and where shift_i is computed so that phi_i(rcut_i) = 0.0.  The model
uses two neighbor lists with different cutoffs and does not request neighbors
of non-contributing particles.

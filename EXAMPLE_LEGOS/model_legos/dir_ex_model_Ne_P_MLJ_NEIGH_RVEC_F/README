This directory (ex_model_Ne_P_MLJ_NIGH_RVEC_F) contains a modified Lennard
Jones (LJ) Model for Neon with smoothed cutoff radius written in C.  It
complies with the KIM API interface standard, using the NEIGH_RVEC_F NBC and
iterator mode, and publishes its parameters, and supports optional computation
of `energy', `forces', `particleEnergy', and `virial'

The following files are in this directory:

Makefile
     Makefile to compile and build executables with GNU or Intel compilers

README
     This file

ex_model_Ne_P_MLJ_NEIGH_RVEC_F.c
     C file that contains the implementation of the LJ potential

ex_model_Ne_P_MLJ_NEIGH_RVEC_F.kim
     KIM descriptor file, contains all variables and methods that are exposed
     through the KIM API interface
